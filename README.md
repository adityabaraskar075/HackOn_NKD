## 🧪 Feature Details

Each feature of QSmartPay has been designed to solve real-world problems in digital payments while offering security, personalization, and accessibility. Below is a detailed explanation of each.

### 🧠 Smart Payment Suggestion

This feature leverages Genkit-based AI flows to intelligently suggest the optimal payment method during checkout. It considers the cart value, type of products, user preferences, historical payment data, and dynamic bank/card offers. For example, if a user is purchasing electronics worth ₹2,499, the system might recommend using an ICICI Amazon card to avail ₹250 cashback and an additional 10% discount.

By streamlining offer discovery and selection, this component improves user experience and encourages better financial decisions.

---

### 🌐 Offline Payments via DAG

This feature enables transaction processing in environments with poor or no internet access. All offline transactions are stored locally and linked cryptographically in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). When connectivity is restored, the system securely syncs and verifies these payments. Expired transactions (48h+) are auto-cancelled.

This ensures that users can continue to shop and pay regardless of connectivity, enhancing reach and reliability in underserved areas.

---

### 📊 Budget Prediction

Using pattern recognition and past transaction data, our AI model predicts the user's estimated budget for the upcoming month. When users initiate a transaction, the system checks current category-wise expenditure and alerts if the budget is likely to be exceeded.

This allows for informed purchase decisions, promoting financial awareness and responsibility.

### 🛡 Fraud Detection using GNN

This component introduces graph-based fraud detection using a simplified Graph Neural Network logic. It tracks the connections between user accounts, devices, merchants, and transaction history to identify suspicious behavior. If a UPI ID or payment method is flagged, the system issues a real-time warning.

It mimics fraud patterns that traditional rule-based engines miss, offering dynamic protection against financial scams.

---

### 🎁 Reward Validation

Our blockchain-based reward system validates eligible transactions on-chain using a smart contract deployed on the Polygon testnet. When a user qualifies for a reward (e.g., QSP tokens for spending ₹5,000+), the contract is invoked to confirm eligibility and issue tokens securely and transparently.

This builds user trust in reward programs while showcasing decentralized automation.

### 🔐 Privacy Preserving Computation

We leverage Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to process sensitive transaction data on the server without ever exposing the raw input. For instance, a user can check whether they’ve exceeded their spending cap without the system ever decrypting their actual spending values.

This ensures unmatched privacy for financial analytics, proving the feasibility of secure, server-side encrypted computation.

## 🧠 AI Models Used

QSmartPay leverages AI/ML in two primary domains to enhance security and personalization:

### 📌 Smart Offer Predictor ([GitHub Repo 🔗](https://github.com/adityabaraskar075/Smart_Offer_Prediction))
This model analyzes multiple contextual factors such as cart category, amount, user history and current promotional campaigns to recommend the most beneficial payment option. It mimics user behavior and learns optimal offer-card-product mappings using a decision tree-based classifier and scoring matrix. This model powers the real-time offer suggestion engine during checkout.

### 📌 GNN Fraud Detection ([GitHub Repo 🔗](https://github.com/adityabaraskar075/GNN_Fraud))
The fraud detection module is designed using a Graph Neural Network that constructs an entity-relationship graph between users, devices, IP addresses, UPI handles and merchants. It flags suspicious transactions based on node centrality, message-passing signals and prior scam node embeddings. It offers explainability via attention weights that help identify which connections contributed to the fraud alert.

These models ensure QSmartPay can deliver real-time, intelligent and secure suggestions tailored to each user.
